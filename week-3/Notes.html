        <ol>Optimization Techniques**: Various optimization techniques (e.g., indexing, caching, sharding) can be applied to improve the performance of database queries.</ol>
    </ul>
    <li>Backup and Recovery</li>
    <ul>
        <ol>Data Backup**: Databases provide mechanisms for regular data backups, ensuring that data can be recovered in case of hardware failures or data corruption.</ol>
        <ol>Disaster Recovery**: Advanced recovery options (e.g., point-in-time recovery, replication) help in quickly restoring the application to its previous state in case of a disaster.</ol>
    </ul>
    <li>Security</li>
    <ul>
        <ol>Access Control**: Databases support role-based access control, allowing administrators to define who can access and modify data.</ol>
        <ol>Encryption**: Data can be encrypted both at rest and in transit, providing an additional layer of security.</ol>
    </ul>
    <li>Reporting and Analytics</li>
    <ul>
        <ol>Data Aggregation**: Databases enable the aggregation of large volumes of data for reporting and analysis.</ol>
        <ol>Business Intelligence**: Integration with BI tools allows for advanced data analysis and visualization, helping businesses make informed decisions.</ol>
    </ul>
</ol>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<h3>Introduction to SQL and NoSQL Databases</h3>

<p>Databases are crucial for storing and managing data in web applications. They fall into two main categories: SQL (relational) and NoSQL (non-relational) databases. Each type has its own characteristics, strengths, and use cases.</p>

<h3>SQL Databases</h3>

<p><strong>SQL (Structured Query Language) databases</strong> are relational databases that use structured schemas and tables to organize data. They are based on a predefined schema, ensuring data consistency and integrity. SQL databases are ideal for applications that require complex queries and transactions.</p>

<h4>Key Characteristics:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Schema-based: Data is stored in tables with fixed schemas, which define the structure of the data (e.g., columns and data types).</li>
    <li>ACID Compliance: SQL databases adhere to ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability), ensuring reliable transactions.</li>
    <li>SQL Query Language: SQL is used to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations and complex queries.</li>
    <li>Relationships**: SQL databases support relationships between tables using foreign keys, enabling complex joins and data normalization.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Common SQL Databases:</h4>
<ul>
    <li><strong>MySQL</strong>: Popular open-source database known for its speed and reliability.</li>
    <li><strong>PostgreSQL</strong>: Advanced open-source database with support for complex queries and extensive data types.</li>
