## Overview

This mentorship series is designed to provide a comprehensive introduction to software engineering. We'll cover a range of topics including front-end and back-end development, version control, project planning, and non-technical skills essential for your career. Each week, we'll dive into different aspects of software development with practical exercises and discussions to help you build a strong foundation.

## Getting Started

To get started, please follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/mentorship-series.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd mentorship-series
   ```
3. **Install Required Tools**: Ensure you have the necessary tools installed (e.g., an IDE like VSCode, Git).

4. **Set Up Your Environment**: Follow the instructions in the `setup` directory for each week's project to set up your development environment.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized into folders for each week, with additional directories for common resources and documentation:

- `/week-1`: Orientation, project setup, Git basics.
- `/week-2`: Front-end development basics and advanced concepts.
- `/week-3`: Back-end development and data management.
- `/week-4`: Full-stack integration and career development.
- `/resources`: General resources, guides, and reading materials.
- `/docs`: Documentation for setting up and working on the projects.

Each weekly folder contains:
- **README.md**: Overview and instructions for the week's sessions.
- **Projects**: Code for the week's exercises and projects.
- **Notes**: Session notes and additional learning materials.
